# Info

This Presentation was held for the completion of my "Project Work", that is required to progress to the master thesis.

# Summary

This goes over methods I applied to generate analytical calculations that were developed for and during my "Project Work" and the "Practical Training" modules.
At the core this talk is about presenting my tool [Math-Manipulator](https://github.com/jonas-kell/math-manipulator).

The sources to this Presentation and the accompanying Repot can be found in the [Master-Thesis-Documents Repository](https://github.com/jonas-kell/master-thesis-documents).
