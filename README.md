# Presentations and Seminars

A single place, where I upload the slides to my presentations held during my University studies.

Generally these were produced as byproducts of lectures or seminars to which I do not have the whole copyright.
Because of this, ONLY the material produced entirely by me is made public and I generally do not include detailed information on the courses themselves.

I maintain this, in order to have a stash of presentations that I can redirect to if someone that listened to my talks wants to take a second look at the material.

## Original files

The original presentation files (Powerpoint/LaTeX) will not be released publicly.
