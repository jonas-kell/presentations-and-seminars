# Info

This Presentation was as a conclusion to my Bachelor Thesis. The thesis can be found here [Bachelor-Thesis: Investigation of transformer architectures for geometrical graph structures and their application to two-dimensional spin systems](https://github.com/jonas-kell/bachelor-thesis-documents).

## Summary

In the thesis the neural network architecture `Graph-Neural-Networks` is explored in the domain of image recognition.
The learned knowledge is applied in the domain of `Quantum-Mechanical Ground-State-Search`, trying to improve the results of established methods.
